## Project Description/Outline:

We will analyze 2018 Divvy rider to answer the questions below. We pulled the data from the City of Chicago website. Our goal is to better understand how the City rides and how we can optimize Divvy's operations.

## Research Questions:

### 1. When are the the most Divvy bikes on the road?

-Average rides over 2018

-Bar graph visualization by hour

-By understanding the most common times and routes that divvy operates, the City can decide where to add new bike lanes.

### 2. What are the most used stops?

-Map 'from station and 'to station' using City of Chicago's Divvy station to map lat/long

-Data from this section will help divvy optimize their bike replenishment routes and ensure that bikes are available where/when needed


### 3. How does weather affect rides? Does ridership change MoM as weather changes?

-This will help Divvy with their workforce planning and ensuring that they have the right number of techincians and Divvy Truck transports on the road.

### 4. Demographic Data

-Viz: Pie chart of gender, pie chart of subscriber vs. one time rides, bar chart of rider age

-This data will help inform Divvy's marketing efforts in new subscriber acquisition
