## Project Description/Outline:

We will analyze 2018 Divvy rider to answer the questions below. We pulled the data from the City of Chicago website. Our goal is to better understand how the City rides and how we can optimize Divvy's operations.

## Research Questions:

### 1. When are the the most Divvy bikes on the road?

-By understanding the most common times and days users ride, Divvy can ensure bikes are available when needed the most.

### 2. What are the most used stops?

-Data from this section will help divvy optimize their bike replenishment routes and ensure that bikes are available where/when needed


### 3. How does weather affect rides? Does ridership change MoM as weather changes?

-This will help Divvy with their workforce planning and ensuring that they have the right number of techincians and Divvy Truck transports on the road.
